Vectorized high-definition (HD) maps contain detailed information about surrounding road elements, which are crucial for various downstream tasks in modern autonomous driving vehicles, such as vehicle planning and control. Recent works have attempted to directly detect the vectorized HD map as a point set prediction task, resulting in significant improvements in detection performance. However, these approaches fail to analyze and exploit the inner-instance correlations between predicted points, impeding further advancements. To address these challenges, we investigate the utilization of inner-<strong>INS</strong>tance information for vectorized h<strong>IGH</strong>-definition mapping through <strong>T</strong>ransformers and introduce InsightMapper. This paper presents three novel designs within InsightMapper that leverage inner-instance information in distinct ways, including hybrid query generation, inner-instance query fusion, and inner-instance feature aggregation. Comparative experiments are conducted on the NuScenes dataset, showcasing the superiority of our proposed method. InsightMapper surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.78 mAP and 5.12 TOPO, which assess topology correctness. Simultaneously, InsightMapper maintains high efficiency during both training and inference phases, resulting in remarkable comprehensive performance.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The paper ‚ÄúOn Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem‚Äù was published by Alan Turing in 1936. In this groundbreaking paper, Turing introduced the concept of a universal computing machine, now known as the Turing machine.</p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>Turing‚Äôs main objective in this paper was to investigate the notion of computability and its relation to the Entscheidungsproblem (the decision problem), which is concerned with determining whether a given mathematical statement is provable or not.</p>

<h2 id="key-ideas">Key Ideas</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Turing first presented the concept of a ‚Äúcomputable number,‚Äù which refers to a number that can be computed by an algorithm or a definite step-by-step process.</li>
  <li>He introduced the notion of a Turing machine, an abstract computational device consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells and a read-write head. The machine can read and write symbols on the tape, move the head left or right, and transition between states based on a set of rules.</li>
  <li>Turing demonstrated that the set of computable numbers is enumerable, meaning it can be listed in a systematic way, even though it is not necessarily countable.</li>
  <li>He proved the existence of non-computable numbers, which cannot be computed by any Turing machine.</li>
  <li>Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can determine, for any given mathematical statement, whether it is provable or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="significance">Significance</h2>
<p>Turing‚Äôs paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing‚Äôs work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers.</p>
